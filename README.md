### Hello there ğŸ‘‹

Currently I'm...
- ğŸ’¼ working as a back-end developer (PHP),
- ğŸŒ± learning game development using C++ and all related stuff.

ğŸ“« How to reach me: kmarkindev@gmail.com

I like to dig into open source game engines and games as well as develop them or their features in my free time.
All of my pinned repos have previews and compiled binaries.
